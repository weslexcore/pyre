### Feature: Perfectly centered hero logo with flanking copy, doubled size (content-agnostic)

Brief source: `docs/briefs/0002_BRIEF.md`

The hero should render the brand logo perfectly centered on the page at 2× its current size, with the copy "Self-care." on the far left of the logo and "Together." on the far right, all on the same horizontal line. Centering must be robust and independent of surrounding content. Must be responsive and accessible.

### Files to change
- `src/pages/index.astro`
  - Replace the current center hero block (the `<img src="/logos/creme/logo.png" ... class="h-50 w-auto" />` within the center container) with a three-column hero row that contains:
    - Left column: text `Self-care.`
    - Center column: brand logo image (creme variant) centered
    - Right column: text `Together.`
  - Keep existing background image, overlay, and header structure.
  - Ensure the logo has non-empty `alt` (e.g., "Pyre Sauna logo") and explicit `width`/`height` attributes to avoid layout shift.
  - Increase the rendered logo size to approximately 2× the current center hero logo. Use responsive constraints (utility classes with `clamp()`-based height/width via arbitrary values) so it scales across breakpoints.

- `src/styles/global.css`
  - Add a small utility or component-level class (e.g., `.hero-row`) to enforce a robust, content-agnostic centering pattern using CSS Grid:
    - `display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr auto 1fr; align-items: center;`
    - This ensures the center column (logo) remains perfectly centered regardless of the side text lengths or other surrounding content.
  - Optionally add helpers to adjust typography and spacing for the flanking copy at various breakpoints, while preserving contrast over the existing hero overlay.

- `src/layouts/main.astro`
  - No structural changes expected. Confirm head tags and preloaded fonts remain as-is. No need to preload the logo image.

### Technical approach
1. Layout algorithm (content-agnostic centering):
   - Use a grid container for the hero row with `grid-template-columns: 1fr auto 1fr` so the logo sits in an auto-sized center column. Left and right columns flex to available space.
   - Place `Self-care.` in column 1 with `justify-self: end` so it sits near the logo. Place `Together.` in column 3 with `justify-self: start` so it sits near the logo. The center column holds the logo and is always centered in the viewport.
   - Keep the existing hero `min-h-[100dvh]` structure; the hero row should be vertically centered within the hero section and unaffected by other content (header, overlays, or subsequent sections).

2. Responsive behavior:
   - Mobile (<=640px): Switch the hero row to a stacked layout (1 column) to maintain readability. Center the logo and place the copy either above and below the logo or on separate lines beneath, maintaining visual balance.
   - Tablet and desktop: Use the 3-column grid. Set side copy to readable sizes (e.g., font scale utilities already present) and keep adequate gap around the logo.

3. Logo sizing at 2×:
   - Replace the current `h-50` usage with a responsive size that is roughly double the previous rendered height. Use an arbitrary utility height with `clamp()` (e.g., `h-[clamp(160px,20vw,320px)]`) and `w-auto` to preserve aspect ratio.
   - Provide `width` and `height` attributes on the `<img>` to minimize CLS. If intrinsic image dimensions are unknown at dev time, measure once (via an image inspector) and set them accordingly.

4. Accessibility and performance:
   - Set `alt="Pyre Sauna logo"` (non-empty) for the hero logo.
   - Keep `loading="eager"` only for the hero logo if it is above the fold; otherwise `lazy` is acceptable. `decoding="async"` is fine.
   - Ensure sufficient text contrast over the overlay and maintain focus styles.

### Concrete edits
- `src/pages/index.astro`
  - Replace the center block under `<!-- Center copy + CTA -->` with a grid row that contains the three elements on one line at tablet/desktop, falling back to stacked on mobile.
  - Add `width`/`height` and `alt` to the hero logo `<img>`.

- `src/styles/global.css`
  - Add `.hero-row` with grid columns `1fr auto 1fr`, `align-items: center`, and responsive adjustments (e.g., stack at small screens). Alternatively, use Tailwind arbitrary values for `grid-template-columns` directly in markup; if so, still add any missing utilities for fine-grained control.

### Test/QA
- Verify perfect centering of the logo regardless of changes to header text, additional sections, or differing copy lengths.
- Check multiple widths (360px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px).
- Confirm alt text presence, no layout shift (thanks to `width`/`height`), and acceptable LCP.
- Ensure side copy remains on the same baseline line as the logo at tablet/desktop.
