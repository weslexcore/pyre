### Feature 0012 — Redesign SIGN UP Section to Match Site Sections

#### Context
Elevate the `SIGN UP` section to visually match the scale and impact of other sections (e.g., `Hero`, `StorySection`). Replace the subdued newsletter block with a bold, section-level design using the brand symbol and the `red_flowers_in_hand.jpeg` photo while preserving existing validation and `/api/subscribe` behavior.

Verbatim from brief:
- **Headline**: `SIGN UP`
- **Subheader**: `Join our mailing list to hear about pre-opening events, news and specials`
- **Imagery**: `/public/images/red_flowers_in_hand.jpeg`
- **Symbol**: `/public/symbols/connection-symbol.png`
- **Form**: Keep existing newsletter form and submit behavior (validation and `/api/subscribe`). Button label may remain `Join the mailing list`.

Current implementation references:
- Section anchor and form live in `src/components/SignupForm.astro` (`<section id="signup" ...>`). Form JS validates email and posts to `/api/subscribe`; success/inline error messaging is shown. CTA focus behavior is triggered from `StorySection.astro` via `href="#signup"` and focusing `#email` after scroll.
- Comparative heading scale: `src/components/StorySection.astro` uses `h2#story-heading` with `font-primary-semibold`, `uppercase`, `tracking-[-0.02em]`, and large responsive sizes.

#### Files to update
- `src/components/SignupForm.astro`
  - Structure, typography, and layout only. Do not change API endpoint or validation logic.

#### Layout and structure plan
Goal: Two-column section on desktop; stacked on mobile.

1) Section wrapper
- Keep `id="signup"` for anchors and existing focus behavior. Maintain contrast: `bg-[var(--card)] text-[var(--card-foreground)]` is acceptable if it continues to pass contrast with the new image panel.
- Replace current narrow container (`max-w-2xl`) with a full-width container consistent with other sections (mirror `StorySection.astro` container width classes). Use a responsive grid similar to `md:grid-cols-12` with a split for copy/form vs. image.

2) Left column: symbol, headline, subheader, form
- Introduce a symbol badge at the top-left of the text column:
  - Circular badge: `rounded-full`, solid fill using a brand color (e.g., `bg-[var(--pyre-blue)]`) and centered symbol image.
  - Symbol image: `src="/symbols/connection-symbol.png"`; `decoding="async"`. Provide descriptive `alt` like "Connection symbol" unless purely decorative (then `alt=""` and `aria-hidden="true"`).
- Headline (exact text): `SIGN UP` with typography that matches `StorySection`:
  - Utilities: `font-primary-semibold uppercase tracking-[-0.02em]`.
  - Size: match or closely mirror `h2#story-heading` scale (`text-[4.236rem] sm:text-[4.618rem]` with `leading-[1.1]`).
- Subheader (exact text): `Join our mailing list to hear about pre-opening events, news and specials` placed under the headline with modest spacing (`mt-2`–`mt-4`).
- Form: reuse existing `<form>` and JS behavior unchanged.
  - Keep label `Email address` and input `#email` to preserve focus logic from `StorySection`.
  - Button label may remain `Join the mailing list`.
  - Ensure spacing aligns in the new layout (`mt-6 sm:mt-8`).

3) Right column: full-height image panel
- Use `/images/red_flowers_in_hand.jpeg` in a container that fills the column height.
- Add `decoding="async"` and use `loading="lazy"` since the section is below the fold.
- Set fixed `width` and `height` attributes to reduce CLS; use object fit/position (`object-cover object-center`).
- Consider visually overlapping the symbol badge slightly over the image edge at `md+` via negative margins or a small absolute offset, while keeping it readable and accessible.

4) Mobile stacking
- Order: image first, then symbol + headline, then subheader and form.
- Maintain generous spacing. Ensure tap targets meet spacing standards.

#### Typography and tokens
- Headline typography mirrors `StorySection` (`font-primary-semibold`, `uppercase`, `tracking-[-0.02em]`, large responsive sizes).
- Use design tokens (Tailwind arbitrary values pointing at CSS variables) already used in the project:
  - Text colors: `text-[var(--foreground)]` (or `text-[var(--card-foreground)]` if maintaining card background).
  - Badge background: `bg-[var(--pyre-blue)]`.
  - Section background: continue `bg-[var(--card)]` unless design calls for alternate surface.

#### Accessibility
- Provide descriptive `alt` for the symbol and main photo, unless decorative (then `alt=""` and `aria-hidden="true"`).
- Preserve visible focus and programmatic focus of `#email` (already handled by `StorySection` CTA script). Keep label association and `aria-live` messaging.
- Ensure color contrast meets AA. Verify text over image is never used; content column should not overlay text directly on the photo.

#### Performance
- Use `loading="lazy"` for the flowers image; keep `decoding="async"`.
- Provide explicit `width`/`height` on the image and avoid layout shifts.
- Keep existing lightweight client-side validation (already present) and fetch POST; no additional JS frameworks introduced.

#### Analytics/events
- Preserve CTA click → focus behavior implemented in `StorySection.astro` (`href="#signup"` + focus `#email`). No changes required.

#### Step-by-step implementation
1. In `src/components/SignupForm.astro`:
   - Keep `<section id="signup">` and the `<script>` validation/fetch block unchanged.
   - Replace the inner container and layout with a responsive grid:
     - Desktop: two columns (text/form left, image right) using `md:grid` with appropriate column spans.
     - Mobile: stack sections vertically and adjust spacing.
   - Add the symbol badge markup above the headline in the left column.
   - Change the heading to exact text `SIGN UP` and apply headline scale to match `StorySection`.
   - Add the subheader paragraph with exact required copy under the headline.
   - Move existing form under the subheader with consistent spacing; keep `#email` and button as-is.
   - Add the flowers image block in the right column with `decoding="async"`, `loading="lazy"`, `object-cover`, and fixed intrinsic dimensions.

2. Verify anchor/focus:
   - Test that clicking the `Join the Waitlist` button in `StorySection` still scrolls and focuses `#email` after layout changes.

#### Testing/QA checklist
- Headline reads exactly `SIGN UP`; scale matches `StorySection` headline scale (uppercase, tight tracking, comparable size/leading).
- Subheader reads exactly `Join our mailing list to hear about pre-opening events, news and specials` and sits under the headline with correct spacing.
- The flowers image appears in the right column (desktop) or first (mobile), uses `decoding="async"`, and lazy-loads.
- The connection symbol badge is prominent and accessible (or marked decorative appropriately).
- Responsive behavior: two-column on desktop, stacked on mobile/tablet, with no layout shifts.
- Form validation and submit continue to work for both JSON fetch and form POST; success/error messages still render and focus management remains intact.
- Colors and typography adhere to the design system tokens; contrast validated.

#### Acceptance criteria (from brief)
1. The section headline reads exactly `SIGN UP` and visually matches the size/weight of `RITUALS FOR MODERN LIFE` in `StorySection.astro` (uppercase, tight tracking, comparable clamp/rem values).
2. The subheader reads exactly `Join our mailing list to hear about pre-opening events, news and specials` and appears directly under the headline with appropriate spacing.
3. `red_flowers_in_hand.jpeg` is used within the section (as a full-height column or large panel) without degrading LCP; image uses `decoding="async"` and appropriate `loading` attributes based on viewport position.
4. An unused symbol on the current page is incorporated — use `connection-symbol.png` — displayed prominently (e.g., circular badge) with accessible alt text.
5. Layout is responsive: two-column on desktop, stacked on mobile/tablet, with no layout shifts; form remains functional.
6. Styling adheres to the existing design system (colors, spacing, and typography) and does not regress hero/story visuals.

#### Notes
- Do not change `/api/subscribe` or the validation script in `SignupForm.astro`.
- Maintain `#signup` anchor and `#email` id for focus behavior triggered from `StorySection.astro`.
- Optimize image size if needed; keep the symbol badge large and clear.
