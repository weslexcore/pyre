## Feature Plan: Landing Page Hero (Pyre Sauna + Cold Plunge)

### Context
Build the initial landing page hero using the Pyre design system. The hero fills the viewport (100vh x 100vw) with a transparent top navigation over a full‑bleed background image (`public/images/hero.png`). It must communicate brand/location/timeline and present a clear signup CTA (button only, no form). Only the hero section is in scope.

Verbatim requirements:
- Transparent navbar with `logo_with_text` in top‑left
- Full‑viewport hero using `public/images/hero.png`
- Overlay hero copy:
  - “Bathhouse reimagined” along the top
  - “Self-care. Together.” centered
  - “Richmond VA Spring 2026” along the bottom
- Follow design rules in @design_system.mdc (2‑color rule, typography, spacing, accessibility)
- Typography must be large and striking; the top and bottom lines should span nearly the full container width
- Do not include a sign up form; provide a single primary "Sign up" button CTA
- Spread text vertically: top text pinned to the top, bottom text pinned to the bottom of the viewport
- Responsive, accessible (labels/focus), performant (optimized image)
- All hero text color must be white (#FFFFFF) for maximum contrast over the image
- Navbar background must be fully transparent (no color and no opacity layer) so logos appear to float in space
- Use the creme logo variant for branding: `public/logos/creme/logo_with_text.png` for both the top‑left navbar brand and a centered hero logo

### Files to Create or Edit
- Edit `src/pages/index.astro`
  - Remove unused `Footer` import if the component is not present
  - Implement hero markup, navbar, background image, overlay content, and a single CTA button
- (minor) Edit `src/layouts/main.astro`
  - No structural change expected; ensure `<body>` can host fixed navbar overlay (it already does). Keep global font preloads.
- Edit `src/styles/global.css`
  - Add minimal utilities if needed for hero overlay gradient and fixed transparent navbar (prefer existing tokens/utilities first)
- Assets
  - Ensure `public/images/hero.png` exists (provided)
  - Use `public/logos/creme/logo_with_text.png` for both the navbar brand (top‑left) and a centered hero logo

### UI Structure and Behavior
1) Navbar (transparent, fixed)
   - Position: fixed; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; z-index above hero
    - Content: left-aligned brand image `logos/creme/logo_with_text.png`
   - Spacing: design system container + vertical padding token
   - Accessibility: brand link to `/`, `alt` text for logo
    - Background: fully transparent; do not apply any color or opacity overlay so the logo appears to float

2) Hero container
   - Wrapper: `section` with min-height: 100dvh; position: relative; overflow: clip
   - Background image: cover, centered. Prefer Astro image optimizations when using an `<Image>` element behind content; if using CSS `background-image`, ensure adequate resolution and fallbacks
   - Overlay: subtle dark gradient to guarantee contrast for text and CTA (e.g., top: 0 -> bottom: 60–80% opacity gradient using brand tokens)
   - Content layout: full-height column with `justify-between`; use safe-area insets. Top line anchored to top, CTA/middle copy centered, bottom line anchored to bottom.

3) Hero text and centered logo (typography)
   - Use brand fonts and provided utilities: `.font-primary-semibold`, `.text-dramatic`, `.text-scale-4` for headline, `.text-scale-2`/`.text-scale-1` for subheads
   - Kerning and line-height per utilities; keep to 2‑color rule (foreground text on dark overlay)
   - Ensure large, all caps, striking type: top “The Bathhouse Reimagined for Richmond and bottom “Richmond VA Spring 2026” should extend nearly the full container width. Allow wrapping, apply negative tracking per design system, and avoid constraining max-width.
    - Color: all hero text must be white (#FFFFFF)
    - Place a centered creme logo above the middle line (use `public/logos/creme/logo_with_text.png`)

4) Signup CTA (button only)
   - Markup: `<a href="/subscribe" class="btn btn-primary">Sign up</a>` (or route of choice)
   - Place near the center stack beneath the middle line (“Self-care. Together.”)
   - Use primary button styling per theme variables; include focus state and visible text label

### Styling and Design System Application
- Follow design rules in @design_system.mdc
- Colors: follow 2‑color rule. Default foreground (text/CTA) on dark overlay; primary (Pyre Red) for CTA button
- Foreground specifics: all hero text and logos should use white/creme on the dark overlay for maximum contrast
- Spacing: use `.container` and padding utilities; avoid custom magic numbers where possible
- Typography: brand font utilities from `global.css` and sizes from `src/lib/fonts.ts`
- Components: stick to semantic HTML with DaisyUI/Tailwind utilities; avoid custom components for this scope

### Image and Performance
- Prefer Astro image service where practical:
  - Option A (preferred): `import hero from '/public/images/hero.png'` and place `<Image src={hero} alt="" aria-hidden="true" ...>` as a background layer (absolute, full bleed)
  - Option B: CSS `background-image` with `background-size: cover; background-position: center;` if layout simplicity is preferred
- Keep hero image high‑quality; defer other non‑critical images with `loading="lazy"` (navbar logo can remain normal due to small size)

### Accessibility
- Ensure color contrast for text and controls over the image using overlay
- Keyboard: tab order logo -> signup button; focus rings already defined; verify visible
- Button text descriptive (e.g., "Sign up")

### Step-by-step Implementation
1) `src/pages/index.astro`
   - Remove `Footer` import and usage if component is not present
   - Add fixed transparent navbar with brand logo link
   - Add hero section with background image layer and gradient overlay
   - Add full-height column layout with top/middle/bottom text positioning; include a primary "Sign up" button (no form)
2) `src/styles/global.css`
   - If needed, add small utilities: `.hero-overlay` gradient; `.nav-transparent` backdrop (or use existing utilities)
3) QA across breakpoints (sm/md/lg/xl) and dark/light background areas of the photo to confirm contrast and readability of large type

### Notes / Out of Scope
- No signup form or backend integration in this phase
- No secondary sections beyond the hero
- Animations are optional; a subtle fade‑in can use `.animate-fade-in-up` if desired
