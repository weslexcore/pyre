# 0008 — Sauna Symbol Above "RITUALS FOR MODERN LIFE"

## Brief description
Add the white sauna symbol (`public/symbols/sauna-symbol.png`) above the "RITUALS FOR MODERN LIFE" heading in the story section. Present it inside a solid black circular background for contrast. The icon must be centered within the circle, visually balanced with the heading, and responsive across breakpoints.

## Files to change
- `src/components/StorySection.astro`

No other files need changes.

## Implementation details
- Insert a circular icon container immediately above the `h2#story-heading` in the right text column of `StorySection.astro`.
- Use a square container with a black background and full rounding. Place the PNG inside and center it using flex utilities.
- Apply responsive sizing to the container and maintain internal padding so the symbol has breathing room within the circle.
- Ensure adequate vertical spacing between the icon and the heading, increasing slightly on larger breakpoints.
- Provide accessible `alt` text for the image (e.g., "Sauna symbol"). If the surrounding content already conveys the same meaning, you may mark the image as decorative (`alt=""` and `aria-hidden="true"`).

## Step-by-step changes
1. In `StorySection.astro`, locate the right column content wrapper (the `div` that contains the `h2#story-heading`).
2. Above the `h2`, add a new icon container element with:
   - Background: `bg-[var(--pyre-black)]`
   - Shape: `rounded-full`
   - Layout: `flex items-center justify-center`
   - Size (mobile → desktop): `w-16 h-16 sm:w-20 sm:h-20 md:w-24 md:h-24 lg:w-28 lg:h-28`
   - Spacing below (to separate from the heading): `mb-6 sm:mb-8`
   - Note: Do not center the entire text block; keep current text alignment. The icon itself should be centered within its circle.
3. Inside that container, place an image referencing `/symbols/sauna-symbol.png` with:
   - Alt text: `alt="Sauna symbol"` (or decorative as noted above)
   - Sizing within the circle to maintain padding: `class="w-2/3 h-2/3 object-contain"`
   - Consider performance attributes consistent with the project (e.g., `decoding="async"`; avoid lazy-loading if the icon is immediately visible on load).
4. Verify responsiveness visually at mobile, tablet, and desktop. Adjust sizes within the stated ranges if needed for balance:
   - Approx. 64–96px diameter on mobile
   - Approx. 96–128px diameter on larger screens
5. Confirm sufficient color contrast: white symbol over solid black circle atop the existing background (`--pyre-creme`).
6. Confirm no reflow or layout issues with the existing grid and content spacing.

## Notes
- Asset path: `/public/symbols/sauna-symbol.png` (referenced at runtime as `/symbols/sauna-symbol.png`).
- Keep existing heading typography and alignment unchanged.
- No updates to `index.astro`, layout, or global styles are required.
