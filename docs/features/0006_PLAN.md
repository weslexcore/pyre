# 0006 — Homepage Below-the-Hero Story Section (Plan)

## Context
Add a new section directly below the hero on the homepage that tells the Pyre story. Desktop layout is a split view with the image on the left and copy on the right. The image must use `public/images/sauna_ladle_multiexposure.jpeg` at full viewport height on desktop. The right side contains a large header (same size as the hero's large headline) and normal-size body text with comfortable line length and spacing.

Verbatim copy to render:
- Header: RITUALS FOR MODERN LIFE
- Body:
  - At Pyre, we’re reimagining the ancient traditions of saunas and cold baths for a modern era.
  - For thousands of years, these healing practices have brought communities together, fostering deep connections while providing restorative experiences for both body and mind. This environment is designed to cultivate joy and meaningful connection, whether you're seeking quiet personal reflection or want to explore a unique social setting.
  - It’s an experience that aims to prioritize your health and help you reconnect with what truly matters, so you’ll leave feeling better than when you walked in. Here, meaningful change begins, one restorative experience at a time.

## Files to Create/Modify
- Create: `src/components/StorySection.astro`
- Modify: `src/pages/index.astro`
  - Import the new component and place it immediately after `<Hero />` and before `<SignupForm />` within `<main>`.
  - Insert a full-width decorative divider strip between `<Hero />` and `<StorySection />` using the image `public/logos/repeating_background.png` as a repeating background that spans the entire page width.

## Component Specifications (`src/components/StorySection.astro`)
- Root element: `<section>` with semantic structure and `aria-labelledby`.
- Layout:
  - Desktop (md+): two-column split using a responsive grid. Left column is the image, right column is the text.
  - Mobile/small screens: stacked layout (image first, text below) with proper spacing.
  - Section minimum height: full viewport height so the image reads immersive on desktop.
  - Right column content vertically centered on desktop; comfortable spacing on mobile.
- Left column (image):
  - Source: `public/images/sauna_ladle_multiexposure.jpeg`.
  - Display: full height of the section (viewport height on desktop). Use object-cover and centered focal point.
  - Include explicit `width`/`height` attributes for CLS stability; `loading="lazy"` and `decoding="async"` for performance.
  - Provide descriptive `alt` text (see Accessibility).
  - Corners: images must be square (no rounded corners). Ensure no utility classes (e.g., `rounded-*`) are applied.
- Right column (text):
  - Heading element: `<h2 id="story-heading">` using same typography scale as hero’s large headline.
    - Match hero headline size by mirroring the hero’s display scale and tracking (same weight and tight tracking). Maintain uppercase styling.
  - Body copy: normal text size, comfortable line length (`max-width` ~65–75ch), generous leading.
  - Spacing: top/bottom margins that visually balance with the left image height.

## Index Integration (`src/pages/index.astro`)
- Import `StorySection.astro`.
- Insert `<StorySection />` immediately under `<Hero />` and above `<SignupForm />` within `<main>`.
- No other structural changes required.

### Pattern Divider (between Hero and Story)
- Add a decorative divider strip between the hero and story sections that spans the full viewport width.
- Implementation: a semantic-neutral container (e.g., `<div aria-hidden="true">`) with a CSS background image of `/logos/repeating_background.png`, `bg-repeat` and `bg-center`, with a fixed height (e.g., `h-12` or `h-16`).
- This divider is purely decorative; do not use an `<img>` tag. Keep it outside landmark roles.

## Typography & Visual Guidance
- Header should match the hero’s large headline scale and tracking. Use the same font family and weight as the hero headings (primary semibold with tight tracking, uppercase).
- Body text uses base size with comfortable line height, constrained measure (`max-w-prose` equivalent) and appropriate spacing between paragraphs.

## Accessibility
- Image `alt` example: “Multi-exposure photograph of a wooden sauna ladle evoking ritual and heat.”
- Use `<section aria-labelledby="story-heading">` and an `<h2 id="story-heading">RITUALS FOR MODERN LIFE</h2>`.
- Ensure color contrast meets WCAG AA against the default background.
- Maintain focus outlines using existing global styles; ensure links/buttons (if any) respect focus states.
 - The divider is decorative; mark it with `aria-hidden="true"` and do not provide alternative text.

## Performance & Stability
- Provide `width` and `height` on the `<img>` to reserve space and avoid CLS.
- Use `loading="lazy"` and `decoding="async"`.
- Ensure the section does not shift when fonts load; fonts are already preloaded in `layouts/main.astro`.
- Keep the image in `public/` per brief; if future optimization is desired, consider moving to `src/assets` to leverage Astro’s image pipeline, which is already configured in `astro.config.mjs`.
 - The divider should use a CSS `background-image` with repeat to avoid layout shift; the element should have an explicit height to reserve space.

## Step-by-Step Implementation
1. Create `src/components/StorySection.astro` with the split layout:
   - Desktop: grid with two columns, left image set to full section height, right text vertically centered.
   - Mobile: stacked with spacing between image and text.
   - Use Tailwind utility classes inline to follow the project’s tailwind-first styling.
2. Ensure the image has square corners (no `rounded-*` classes).
3. Add semantic heading and body text using the exact copy from the brief.
4. Add an accessible, descriptive `alt` to the image.
5. Integrate into `src/pages/index.astro` right after `<Hero />`.
6. Insert the full-width repeating pattern divider between the hero and story sections using `/logos/repeating_background.png`.
7. Verify spacing between header, paragraphs, and section boundaries for comfortable reading.
8. Manually test common viewports: 375px (mobile), 768px (tablet), 1280px and 1440px (desktop).
9. Validate no CLS in Performance tab and check Lighthouse for accessibility.

## QA Checklist
- Section appears directly below the hero and above the signup section on `src/pages/index.astro`.
- Desktop shows a split view: full-viewport-height image on the left; text on the right.
- Mobile stacks image above the text with proper spacing.
- Header matches the hero’s large headline size and style (same weight/tracking/uppercase).
- Body copy is readable with comfortable measure and leading.
- Image has descriptive alt text; section uses semantic roles.
- No layout shift when loading; images lazy-load offscreen.
- Color contrast meets AA.
 - Image corners are square (no rounding).
 - A full-width divider strip using `/logos/repeating_background.png` appears between the hero and story sections, repeats seamlessly, and is marked decorative.
