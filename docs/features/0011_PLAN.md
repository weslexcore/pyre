# 0011 — Experiences Section (Plan)

## Context
Add a new "EXPERIENCES" section immediately below the existing `StorySection` on the homepage. The section highlights three experience modes offered by the sauna: `SOCIAL`, `MEDITATIVE`, and `GUIDED`. Each mode is presented as a card with a symbol, a title, and concise supporting copy. Match the `StorySection` heading scale and maintain visual consistency with existing typography, spacing, and container widths.

Verbatim content to render per brief:
- **Header**: "EXPERIENCES" (match the display scale used in `StorySection` heading)
- **Cards**:
  - **SOCIAL**
    - Symbol: `public/symbols/connection-symbol.png`
    - Copy:
      - 50 person Scandinavian sauna, large hot pool, teas and tonics, lounge seating
      - Cultivating connection
      - Encouraging understanding
      - Enjoying Life
  - **MEDITATIVE**
    - Symbol: `public/symbols/harmony-symbol.png`
    - Copy:
      - A 20 person sauna, 20 person cold plunge, space for breathwork + bodywork 
      - Disconnecting from technology
      - Finding meaning
  - **GUIDED**
    - Symbol: `public/symbols/transformation-symbol.png`
    - Copy:
      - Guided classes that blend the thermic cycle (sauna, cold bathing, and resting) with meditation, breathwork, sound baths and more
      - Prioritizing one’s health
      - Self-care

Visual layout requirements:
- **Desktop**: three-up card grid
- **Tablet**: two-up grid
- **Mobile**: single column stack
- **Accessibility**: meaningful `alt` text per symbol, semantic headings, readable contrast, keyboard focus states
- **Visual consistency**: typography scale and spacing aligned to `StorySection`; symbols sized consistently across cards

## Files to Create/Modify
- Create: `src/components/ExperiencesSection.astro`
- Modify: `src/pages/index.astro`
  - Import and render `<ExperiencesSection />` immediately after `<StorySection />` and before `<SignupForm />`.
  - Add decorative divider strips (using the existing `bg-repeating-logo` pattern) above and/or below the new section to match the pattern used around `StorySection` for visual continuity.

## Component Specifications (`src/components/ExperiencesSection.astro`)
- Root element: `<section>` with `aria-labelledby="experiences-heading"`.
- Container: mirror `StorySection` horizontal padding and max-width container (`mx-auto w-full px-4 sm:max-w-screen-sm md:max-w-screen-md lg:max-w-screen-lg xl:max-w-screen-xl`).
- Heading:
  - `<h2 id="experiences-heading">EXPERIENCES</h2>`
  - Match `StorySection` heading scale (uppercase, tight tracking, same weight). Keep readable contrast on current background.
- Grid layout:
  - Use responsive grid utilities: 1 column on mobile, 2 on tablet, 3 on desktop.
  - Provide comfortable gaps consistent with `StorySection` spacing.
- Card structure (repeated for the three modes):
  - Semantic grouping per card (e.g., `<article>`), with a heading `<h3>` for the mode name: "SOCIAL", "MEDITATIVE", "GUIDED".
  - Symbol at top of card: use provided PNGs from `public/symbols/*.png`; ensure consistent rendered size across cards.
  - Descriptive, meaningful `alt` text for each symbol (e.g., "Symbol representing connection/community" for `connection-symbol.png`, "Symbol representing calm and balance" for `harmony-symbol.png`, "Symbol representing growth and transformation" for `transformation-symbol.png`).
  - Supporting copy rendered as short paragraphs or a list; maintain comfortable line length (≈65–75ch) and line-height consistent with site typography.
  - Ensure cards maintain readable contrast, use brand colors, and avoid introducing new color tokens.
- Accessibility:
  - Semantic headings and landmark: section labeled via `aria-labelledby`.
  - If cards later become links, wrap with a single interactive element and ensure visible focus rings (global focus styles already present in `global.css`).
  - Provide `loading="lazy"` and `decoding="async"` on symbol `<img>` elements; include explicit `width`/`height` or size via CSS to minimize layout shift.
- Performance:
  - Use static assets from `/public/symbols`; ensure images are not oversized; set consistent display dimensions to avoid CLS.

## Index Integration (`src/pages/index.astro`)
- Import `ExperiencesSection.astro` at the top with other components.
- Insert `<ExperiencesSection />` immediately after `<StorySection />` and before `<SignupForm />` within `<main>`.
- Maintain a single decorative divider between the new section and `SignupForm`:
  - Current structure: `Hero` → divider → `StorySection` → divider → `SignupForm`.
  - Target structure: `Hero` → divider → `StorySection` → `ExperiencesSection` → divider → `SignupForm`.
  - Implementation detail: move the existing divider that currently sits after `StorySection` to be after `ExperiencesSection` (do not add an extra divider).

## Rendering/Data Approach (no code, structure only)
- Define an in-file data array of three experience objects (no external data source needed):
  - `title` ("SOCIAL" | "MEDITATIVE" | "GUIDED")
  - `symbolSrc` (string path to PNG under `/symbols`)
  - `symbolAlt` (meaningful alt text per above)
  - `bullets` (array of strings for the supporting copy, exactly as provided in the brief)
- Map over this array to generate cards in the responsive grid. Keep the heading and layout outside the map.

## Responsive Behavior
- Mobile: single column; cards stack with generous vertical spacing; symbol sizes scale down but remain visually consistent.
- Tablet: two columns; maintain readable line length; balanced gutters.
- Desktop: three columns; equal card heights where feasible (use intrinsic content height with consistent paddings).

## Styling & Design System Notes
- Use Tailwind utilities per project convention; avoid creating new global CSS.
- Reuse tokens and fonts defined in `src/styles/global.css` (`--pyre-creme`, `--foreground`, font utility classes `font-primary-*`).
- Keep backgrounds and text colors consistent with surrounding sections (likely creme background with dark foreground as in `StorySection`).
- Match `StorySection` heading scale and spacing for the "EXPERIENCES" header.

## QA/Accessibility Checklist
- Heading structure is logical: hero > story (`h2`) > experiences (`h2`) > per-card titles (`h3`).
- All images have meaningful alt text; no purely decorative images without `alt=""` unless truly decorative.
- Keyboard focus is visible on any interactive elements; tab order is sensible.
- Layout matches: 3-up (desktop), 2-up (tablet), 1-up (mobile).
- Symbols are consistently sized and align baseline across cards.
- Contrast meets WCAG AA against the chosen background.
