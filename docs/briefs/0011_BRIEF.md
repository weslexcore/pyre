# Experiences Section Brief

## 1) Project overview / description
Add a new "EXPERIENCES" section immediately below the existing `StorySection` on the homepage. The section highlights three experience modes offered by the sauna: `SOCIAL`, `MEDITATIVE`, and `GUIDED`. Each mode is presented as a card with a symbol, a title, and concise supporting copy.

## 2) Target audience
- Community seekers and social wellness enthusiasts interested in group experiences
- Individuals looking for quiet, reflective, or tech-free wellness time
- Guests seeking structure and expert-led modalities (e.g., guided sauna, breathwork, yoga)
