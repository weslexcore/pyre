## Usage Guidelines

### Design Principles
- **Large and Visible**: Symbols should be large and very visible as primary visual elements
- **Bold Presence**: Use symbols as prominent visual statements, not subtle accents
- **High-Contrast Aesthetic**: Ensure symbols complement the high-contrast aesthetic
- **Visual Impact**: Symbols should create strong visual impact and draw attention
- **Typography Integration**: Consider symbol placement in relation to typography and color usage

### Implementation
- **File Path**: `/public/symbols/`
- **Format**: PNG with transparency
- **Sizing**: Use large sizes by default for maximum visibility and impact
- **Placement**: Position symbols as prominent visual elements that command attention

### Color Usage with Symbols
- Follow the "no more than 2 colors together" rule
- Symbols should work with the established color combinations:
  - Pyre Black + Pyre Creme
  - Pyre Blue + Pyre Creme
  - Pyre Red + Pyre Black/Creme

### Responsive Considerations
- Ensure symbols remain large and visible across all breakpoints
- Maintain strong visual impact on mobile devices
- Prioritize symbol visibility over other design elements

## Best Practices
1. **Large and Visible**: Always prioritize large, visible symbol presentation
2. **Context**: Ensure symbols are contextually appropriate while maintaining prominence
3. **Accessibility**: Provide alt text for screen readers
4. **Performance**: Optimize symbol file sizes for web use
5. **Brand Alignment**: Ensure symbols align with Pyre's brand personality
6. **Visual Dominance**: Let symbols be the primary visual focus in their sections

## Technical Implementation

### Using the Symbol Component
```astro
---
import Symbol from './ui/Symbol.astro';
---

<!-- Available symbols: sauna, community, connection, growth, harmony, healing, ritual, transformation, wellness -->
<!-- Default to large sizes for maximum visibility -->
<Symbol name="sauna" size="xl" className="symbol-prominent" />
<Symbol name="wellness" size="xl" />
<Symbol name="healing" size="lg" />
```

### Direct Image Usage
```html
<!-- Example usage in Astro components -->
<img 
  src="/symbols/sauna-symbol.png" 
  alt="Sauna therapy symbol" 
  class="symbol-large"
/>
```

### CSS Styling
```css
/* Symbol styling - Large and visible by default */
.symbol-large {
  width: 120px;
  height: 120px;
  opacity: 1;
  transition: transform 0.3s ease;
}

.symbol-large:hover {
  transform: scale(1.05);
}

.symbol-prominent {
  width: 160px;
  height: 160px;
  opacity: 1;
  transition: transform 0.3s ease;
}

.symbol-prominent:hover {
  transform: scale(1.05);
}

/* Responsive symbol sizing - Large sizes by default */
.symbol-sm {
  width: 80px;
  height: 80px;
}

.symbol-md {
  width: 120px;
  height: 120px;
}

.symbol-lg {
  width: 160px;
  height: 160px;
}

.symbol-xl {
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
}

.symbol-xxl {
  width: 240px;
  height: 240px;
}
```

## Symbol Placement Guidelines

### Hero Sections
- Use extra-large symbols (xl/xxl size) for maximum visual impact
- Position symbols as the primary visual focus alongside headline text
- Make symbols the dominant visual element in hero sections

### Service Cards
- Use large symbols (lg/xl size) for service identification
- Position symbols prominently above service titles
- Make symbols the main visual element of each service card

### Navigation Elements
- Use medium-large symbols (md/lg size) for navigation
- Ensure symbols are clearly visible and not overshadowed by text
- Use symbols as primary visual indicators

### Footer and Sidebar
- Use large symbols (lg size) for accent elements
- Position symbols prominently to enhance content visibility
- Maintain brand consistency while ensuring symbols are clearly visible

## Accessibility Requirements

### Alt Text Guidelines
- Provide descriptive alt text for all symbols
- Include the service or concept the symbol represents
- Keep alt text concise but informative

```html
<!-- Good alt text examples -->
<img src="/symbols/sauna-symbol.png" alt="Sauna therapy symbol" />
<img src="/symbols/community-symbol.png" alt="Community building symbol" />
<img src="/symbols/healing-symbol.png" alt="Healing and wellness symbol" />
```

### Screen Reader Considerations
- Symbols should enhance understanding, not replace text
- Ensure symbols have proper semantic meaning
- Test with screen readers to verify accessibility

## Performance Optimization

### File Size Guidelines
- Keep symbol files under 20KB when possible (increased for larger symbols)
- Use PNG format for transparency support
- Consider WebP format for modern browsers
- Optimize images for web delivery

### Loading Strategies
- Use lazy loading for symbols below the fold
- Preload critical symbols used in hero sections
- Consider using CSS sprites for multiple symbols
